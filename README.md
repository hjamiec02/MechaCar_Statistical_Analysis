# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to help a company called MechaCar, that is suffering from production troubles. The company is hoping to resolve some of these issues through a data analytic review.

The goals for this review are as follows:

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.

- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.

- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Results

Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

- Vehicle_length and ground_clearance are significant at all levels.
- The slope of the linear model is not 0 due to small p-value and can explain 68% of variability of mpg with adjust R-squared
- Engine size could be an additional factor that is missing 

Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition:

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
